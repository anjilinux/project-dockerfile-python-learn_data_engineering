# [Quick Start Python Packages](https://the-hitchhikers-guide-to-packaging.readthedocs.io/en/latest/quickstart.html)

### 1. A python packages is structured as:

My_App/
    LICENSE.txt
    README.txt
    setup.py
    my_app/
        __init__.py

### 2. setup.py
The setup.py file is at the heart of a Python project. It describes all of the metadata about your 
project. There are only three required fields: name, version, and packages. 

 - Name field must be unique if you wish to publish your package on the Python Package Index (PyPI).
 - Version field keeps track of different releases of the project.
 - Packages field describes where you’ve put the Python source code within your project.

### 3. Create a release
To create a release, your source code needs to be packaged into a single archive file. This can be done 
with the sdist command:

	$ python setup.py sdist

his will create a dist sub-directory in your project, and will wrap-up all of your project’s source 
code files into a distribution file (tar.gz or .zip).

### 4. create an installer
Create a bdist_wininst distribution file of our project, which will create a Windows installable file. 

	$ python setup.py sdist bdist_wininst upload
