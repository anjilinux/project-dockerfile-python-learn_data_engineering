Dave, a 72-year-old bus driver living in the Ham area of Plymouth, is no party loyalist. He has voted both Conservative and Labour before and is proud to be a swing voter. “I swing for common sense,” he says. “I’ve voted for both parties when different scenarios have come up at different times.” In this week’s local elections he will vote for his Labour councillor, Gareth Derrick, because, he says, he’s one of the few politicians who will stop for a chat. Plymouth is the biggest city in Devon with a population of about 260,000. A garrison town and home to western Europe’s largest naval base, it is a classic bellwether seat, with areas of high deprivation and areas of wealth. The council fell to Labour last year, the sixth time it had changed hands since 2000. Other than the Tory safe seat of South West Devon, only part of which falls within the city limits, the two parliamentary constituencies in Plymouth are marginals. The Conservative Johnny Mercer took Plymouth Moor View from Labour in 2015, while Labour’s Luke Pollard won Plymouth Sutton and Devonport from the Conservatives in 2017 – helped by a growing population of students in the city centre.
